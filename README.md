=============

My first meteor app! This is a proof of concept for a voting system app.

To get it running, have [meteor installed](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Supported-Platforms) then just run:

    meteor

from within your project.

Before deploying to production, run:

    meteor remove autopublish
    meteor remove insecure

Then:

    meteor deploy myapp.meteor.com

(as per [the docs](http://docs.meteor.com/#deploying) )
